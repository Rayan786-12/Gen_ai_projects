## Examples

Here are example of input and assistant output , pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.
<example>
<user:input>
Bears  are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
</user:input>
<score>5</score>
<score_reasons>
-GOOD: shows the words in japanese
-BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
-BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs because the student needs to figure that out.
- BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this :
[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]

<assistant:output>
Let's break down the sentence! Here's a vocabulary table to help you get started:
|Japanese	|Romaji	|English        |
|熊	        |kuma	|bear           |
|門	        |mon	|door           |
|ゴミ	    |gomi	|garbage        |
|出す	    |dasu	|leave, take out|
|あなた	    |anata	|you            |
Possible sentence structure:
Topic (Bears) + Location (at the door)
Question (did you) + Verb (leave) + Object (garbage) + Direction (out)
Think about how to connect the ideas:
How do you say "bears are at the door" using the vocabulary above?
How do you ask someone if they did something (leave the garbage out)?
</assistant:output>
</example>

<example>

<user:input>
Bears  are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
</user:input>
<score>10</score>
<score_reasons>
-GOOD: doesnt provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediately
-GOOD: It is more responsive giving hints and clues
-GOOD: Clues dont give away any of the tense of conjugations

</score_reasons>
<assistant:output>
Great! Let's work through this sentence step by step. This is actually two sentences, so we'll break it down.

## Vocabulary Table

| Japanese | Romaji | English | Type |
|----------|---------|---------|------|
| 熊 | kuma | bear | Noun |
| ドア | doa | door | Noun |
| ゴミ | gomi | garbage/trash | Noun |
| 外 | soto | outside | Noun |
| いる | iru | to be (animate) | Verb |
| 出す | dasu | to put out/take out | Verb |
| あなた | anata | you | Pronoun |

## Sentence Structure Hints

**First sentence (Bears are at the door):**
- Structure: [Subject] + は + [Location] + に + [Existence verb]
- Think about: How do we show location? What particle shows "at"?
- Remember: For living things being somewhere, which verb do you use?

**Second sentence (Did you leave the garbage out?):**
- Structure: [Subject] + は + [Object] + を + [Location] + に + [Verb in past tense] + か
- This is a question, so you need the question particle at the end
- Think about: What's the past tense form of the verb "to put out"?
- The subject "you" is often dropped in Japanese, but you can include it for practice

## Clues to help you:

1. "Bears" - plural in English, but Japanese doesn't always mark plural. You might see 熊たち for emphasis
2. The particle に marks a location where something exists
3. Questions end with か
4. Past tense verbs typically end in た or だ
5. を marks the direct object (what is being put out)

Give it a try! What's your attempt at translating these sentences?

Considerations:
- This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
- The first part is stating a location where something exists
- The second part is asking about a past action

Possible next steps:
- attempt an answer
- ask clues about location marking
- ask clues about question formation
- ask  clues about verb conjugation
